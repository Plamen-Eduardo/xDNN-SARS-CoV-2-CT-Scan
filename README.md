The infection by SARS-CoV-2 wich causes the COVID-19 disease has widely spread all over the world since the beginning of 2020.
On January 30, 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global health emergency.
Researchers of different disciplines work along with public health officials to understand the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and jointly with the policymakers urgently develop strategies to control the spread of this new disease.
Recent findings have observed imaging patterns on computed tomography (CT) for patients infected by SARS-CoV-2. 
In this paper, we build a public available COVID-CT dataset, containing 1252 CT scans that are positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) and 1230 CT scans for patients non-infected by SARS-CoV-2. 
These data have been collected from real patients in hospitals from Sao Paulo, Brazil. 
The aim of this dataset is to encourage the research and development of artificial intelligent methods which are able to identify if a person is is infected by SARS-CoV-2 through the analysis of his/her CT scans. 
As baseline result for this dataset we used an eXplainable Deep Learning approach (xDNN) which we could achieve an F1 score of 0.9877 which is very promising.
The data is available www.kaggle.com/plameneduardo/sarscov2-ctscan-dataset.
